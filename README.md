## Transaction Process Flow

1. Department Supply Coordinator creates an RIS Form or Request.
2. They can choose available Supply or Equipment from the Admin's records. If not available, they can input a unique Supply or Equipment.
3. The RIS Form is sent to the Admin.
4. If the RIS Form contains both Supply and Equipment categories, the system will automatically separate them.
5. The Admin receives the RIS Form in the Pending Request Panel.
6. The Admin can approve or reject the RIS Form.
7. If approved, the requested items are added to the Department Supply Coordinator's records and quantities are adjusted in the Admin's records.
